# Data Shape Kit

Data Shape Kit is a small command-line tool for deterministic CSV cleanup and privacy-preserving profile summaries. It normalizes headers, trims surrounding cell whitespace, removes exact duplicate rows, and reports aggregate shape counts locally.

## Requirements

- Python 3.11 or newer

## Install

```bash
python -m pip install data-shape-kit
```

## Use

```bash
data-shape-kit input.csv cleaned.csv
```

Example report:

```text
Input rows: 3
Output rows: 2
Duplicates removed: 1
```

The output keeps the first occurrence of each row after trimming surrounding whitespace. Column names are lowercased, converted to underscore-separated names, and made unique with numeric suffixes.

Profile a CSV without copying its cell values into the report:

```bash
data-shape-kit --profile input.csv profile.json
```

The JSON profile reports input row and column counts plus each normalized column's empty values and distinct non-empty values. It does not include source cell values.

## Data privacy

Processing is local. The tool has no runtime dependencies, makes no network requests, and does not retain a copy of the input. Profile mode holds distinct values only in process memory while counting and does not include source cell values in its JSON output.

## Limitations

- Input must be UTF-8 CSV with one header row.
- Every data row must contain the same number of columns as the header.
- Duplicate detection is exact after trimming surrounding whitespace; it does not perform fuzzy matching.
